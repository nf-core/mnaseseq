## [[1.0.0](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/1.0.0)] - 2022-05-25

Initial release of nf-core/mnaseseq, created with the [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) template.

This is a legacy release so that we can create a stable and reproducible tagged version of the pipeline for users of the pipeline. This has been requested on nf-core Slack and sadly I don't have time to properly bring the pipeline up to the bestest and latest practices on nf-core.
